This UE4 Project is a Survival Top-Down Game that when started you will fight waves of enemies that will try to take down your health. 
However, your job is to try to defeat all of them with sword slashes (left click) or shoot fire spell (right click). Be careful of the 
enemies that will grow in numbers every wave and will grow in difficulty. The enemies will try to dough your attacks by running away 
when seeing you charge up your fire spell if their health is low enough or will try to rush you if your health is low enough, so be
careful and strategize. If your health is low enough you can walk by the blue sparks on the floor, they will heal your health 
but be aware that the low health enemy could also steal the healing sparks by getting to it first, but these sparks respawn in a 
different location so try to get to them before your enemies do. For each wave won the next wave will have more enemies spawned and 
will be more difficult so take care of these enemies but make sure you use all your resources.
